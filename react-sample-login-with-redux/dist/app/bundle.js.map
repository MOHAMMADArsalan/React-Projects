The arguments passed to this function are:\n * - `outerValue`: the value that came from the source\n * - `innerValue`: the value that came from the projected Observable\n * - `outerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value that came from the source\n * - `innerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value from the projected Observable\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the result of applying the\n * projection function (and the optional `resultSelector`) to each item emitted\n * by the source Observable and taking only the values from the most recently\n * projected inner Observable.\n * @method switchMap\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction switchMap(project, resultSelector) {\n    return this.lift(new SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector));\n}\nexports.switchMap = switchMap;\nvar SwitchMapOperator = (function () {\n    function SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector) {\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n    }\n    SwitchMapOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n        return source.subscribe(new SwitchMapSubscriber(subscriber, this.project, this.resultSelector));\n    };\n    return SwitchMapOperator;\n}());\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nvar SwitchMapSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(SwitchMapSubscriber, _super);\n    function SwitchMapSubscriber(destination, project, resultSelector) {\n        _super.call(this, destination);\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n        this.index = 0;\n    }\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n        var result;\n        var index = this.index++;\n        try {\n            result = this.project(value, index);\n        }\n        catch (error) {\n            this.destination.error(error);\n            return;\n        }\n        this._innerSub(result, value, index);\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._innerSub = function (result, value, index) {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (innerSubscription) {\n            innerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n        }\n        this.add(this.innerSubscription = subscribeToResult_1.subscribeToResult(this, result, value, index));\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (!innerSubscription || innerSubscription.closed) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._unsubscribe = function () {\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyComplete = function (innerSub) {\n        this.remove(innerSub);\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n        if (this.isStopped) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex, innerSub) {\n        if (this.resultSelector) {\n            this._tryNotifyNext(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        else {\n            this.destination.next(innerValue);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._tryNotifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) {\n        var result;\n        try {\n            result = this.resultSelector(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        catch (err) {\n            this.destination.error(err);\n            return;\n        }\n        this.destination.next(result);\n    };\n    return SwitchMapSubscriber;\n}(OuterSubscriber_1.OuterSubscriber));\n//# sourceMappingURL=switchMap.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/operator/switchMap.js\n// module id = 282\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?

This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction combineLatest() {\n    var observables = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    var project = null;\n    var scheduler = null;\n    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n        scheduler = observables.pop();\n    }\n    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n        project = observables.pop();\n    }\n    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\n    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\n        observables = observables[0];\n    }\n    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\n}\nexports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\n//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/combineLatest.js\n// module id = 322\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?

If however you set delay to `0`, `asap` will wait for current synchronously executing\n * code to end and then it will try to execute given task as fast as possible.\n *\n * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code\n * and start of scheduled task. This makes it best candidate for performing so called \"deferring\".\n * Traditionally this was achieved by calling `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`, but that technique involves\n * some (although minimal) unwanted delay.\n *\n * Note that using `asap` scheduler does not necessarily mean that your task will be first to process\n * after currently executing code. In particular, if some task was also scheduled with `asap` before,\n * that task will execute first. That being said, if you need to schedule task asynchronously, but\n * as soon as possible, `asap` scheduler is your best bet.\n *\n * @example <caption>Compare async and asap scheduler</caption>\n *\n * Rx.Scheduler.async.schedule(() => console.log('async')); // scheduling 'async' first...\n * Rx.Scheduler.asap.schedule(() => console.log('asap'));\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // \"asap\"\n * // \"async\"\n * // ... but 'asap' goes first!\n *\n * @static true\n * @name asap\n * @owner Scheduler\n */\nexports.asap = new AsapScheduler_1.AsapScheduler(AsapAction_1.AsapAction);\n//# sourceMappingURL=asap.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/scheduler/asap.js\n// module id = 553\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?
